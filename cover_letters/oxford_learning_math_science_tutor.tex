  \opening{Dear recruiter:}

  I am writing to apply for the on-call math and science tutor position at Oxford Learning Centre. As a University of Toronto student with a solid academic background - having taken the IB, AP, and SAT and scored well - I am eager to share my knowledge and problem-solving skills with other learners.
